//1
/*
a_THE VALUE OF p is cero' 
b_i incremented 1 with p++
c_now p is one, but i still cant see it in the console
d_now the Value of c is one because of p'
e_when i console log C' it will show me the 
result of c has a value 1.
//DECREMENT
*/

let h = 0;
++h;
let e = h;
console.log(e);

/*
Suppose p=5;

When we assign x=++p the increment
 operation is carried out first and 
 then the value of p is assigned to x. 
 So both p and x are set to 6

When we assign x=p++ the increment 
operation is carried out after the
 value of p is assigned to x. So x is 
 set to 5 while p is incremented to 6.
